labdsv 1.2-1

function tabdev.R was deleted to temporarily solve inscutable
problems with Windows server.  tabdev.R worked under linux
and Windows XP, so there may be no need to update on your system.

In addition, the URL in the decsription file was updated to 
point to the current location of the lab manual for LabDSV.

labdsv 1.2-0

A couple of general changes were made to many functions.

1) in several functions the dataframe "veg" was changed to "taxa"
   to better represent the full range of community ecology the code
   is suitable for

2) in functions that used classified types or community types the
   vector specifying that was changed from "class" to "clustering"
   to avoid conflict with a reserved word, and to integrate better
   with code from package "cluster".

3) the package was checked and built on both linux and Windows to
   help ensure better utility on windows

In addition, a number of small changes were made to several functions,
listed below:

	removed function dissim
dsvdis.R
	changed an attribute label from "index" to "method" to
		match dist()

	improved the default title on the plot
euclidify.R
	cast the input object to class "dist"

		match dist()
nmds.R
	deleted test for null class
	changed the name of the overlayed object in the 
		points.nmds function from "overlay" to "which"
	added "cex=0.8" as the default to function surf.nmds and jsurf.nmds
	corrected logical values from "T" to "TRUE"	
	improved the bestnmds function
	improved the hilight function by adding better control of colors
		and glyphs
	added a convex hull function called chullord.nmds()
